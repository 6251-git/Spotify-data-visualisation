How can these findings be used?
------------
One of the main ways this data can be used is for user personalisation. Knowing whats popular and where, can help Spotify with suggestion the right track to its users.
It could see which artists are popular in the users home town and link it to other artists they already listen too to make specifically tailored track, artist and playlist suggestions. Track length data is also important for similar reasons, Spotify could use this data to recommend certain tracks based on length, for example, if the algorithm finds one track of a certain artist that the user likes it might not recommend that certain track if it can see that the user doesnt typically listen to tracks of that kind of length and instead may chose track similar in length to that the user listens to more often. Track length data can also be linked to artist and track popularity data so that Spotify can see how long more popular tracks are among its users generally, so that the algorithm knows to push more tracks of similar length.
