How can these findings be used?
------------
One of the main ways this data can be used is for user personalisation. Knowing whats popular and where, can help Spotify with suggesting the right track to its users.
It could see which artists are popular where the user lives and link it to other artists they already listen too to make specifically tailored track, artist and playlist suggestions. Track length data can also be used to tailor suggestions to users based on the length of tracks they normally listen to. Track length and artist popularity data can also be used to find how long the most popular tracks typically are and push tracks that are around that length to users. Knowing what artist and tracks are popular at the time also tells Spotify what artists and tracks they should be using in their marketing.
